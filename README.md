# ranking_based_ona_column
Create ranks based on a column in a MySQL table having numeric data
Suppose we have a CSV file with fields name and marks, of few records that needed to quickly rank based on marks obtained. The possibilities are, 
2 or more records can have the same marks (hence same rank).
We first create the MySQL table scorespb2.sql for uploading the data from the csv file, this is particularly useful when there are many records.
